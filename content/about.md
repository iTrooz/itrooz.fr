hello there !
My name is **iTrooz**, I'm a french computer science student, currently studing for a BUT.

Computer science has been a passion of mine since my youth. I like to touch at everything, from Linux to data science *except web frontend*.

That said, I particulary like low level stuff and reverse-engineering, and generally speaking poking at computers with a stick
